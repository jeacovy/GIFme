# READme GIFme // **Keeping README's cool one repo at a time!** [![CI](https://github.com/jeacovy/readme-gifme/actions/workflows/config.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jeacovy/readme-gifme/actions/workflows/config.yml)

###### **But why?**
Good question. The goal is to provide engineering teams with an easy way to add pazzaz to their README files. That's litteraly it!

###### **What about a use case?**
Perfect for pipeline builds. Imagine a unqiue GIF generated each time you release. Something to match your awesome, unique, and over thought up release name *(yes, I said it!)*.

###### **Why can't I just copy and paste?**
Let's think about that. You would have to find a GIF, copy, and paste. Oh yeah, then lets save it... Where as this does it all for you, without you having to think. What more could you ask for? 

But seriously though, who would want to do such a mondane task? Gross.

###### **Usage**
- [Request A GIPHY API Key](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020283431-Request-A-GIPHY-API-Key)
- Replace ```[GIPHY_API_KEY]``` in the ```.sh``` file or add this as an environment secret. *(REMEMBER, DO NOT COMMIT SECRET VALUES INTO PUBLIC REPO)*
- Change ```tag``` in the ```.sh``` to a key word of your interest
- Thats it. Enjoy!

Do note that this only supports adding a GIF to the top of the README file.

###### **Just a friendly note:**
All memes are **Rated G** *(means ISFW)*
