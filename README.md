# READme//GIFme: **Keeping README's cool one repo at a time!**
###### **Does things work?**
[![CI](https://github.com/jeacovy/readme-gifme/actions/workflows/config.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jeacovy/readme-gifme/actions/workflows/config.yml)

###### **But why this though?**
Good question. The goal is to provide engineering teams with an easy way to add pazzaz to their README files. That's litteraly it!

###### **What about a use case?**
Perfect for pipeline builds. Imagine a unqiue GIF generated each time you release. Something to match your awesome, unique, and overly thought up release name *(yes, I said it!)*.

###### **Why can't I just copy and paste?**
Let's think about that. You would have to find a GIF, copy, and paste. Oh yeah, then lets save it... Where as this does it all for you, without having to think. What more could you ask for? 

But seriously though, who would want to do such a mondane task? Gross.

###### **Usage**
- [Request A GIPHY API Key](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020283431-Request-A-GIPHY-API-Key)
- Replace ```[GIPHY_API_KEY]``` in the ```.sh``` file or add this as an environment variable. *(REMEMBER, DO NOT COMMIT SECRET VALUES INTO PUBLIC REPO)*
- Change ```tag``` in the ```.sh``` file or add this as an environment variable. This is just a keyword *(i.e,. mood)*. Without a tag, GIPHY pulls from a random pool *(likely popular gifts)*
- Thats it. Enjoy!

###### **Notes**
- Current support is only for adding a GIF at the top of the README files within the root of your codebase.
- Most importantly, all memes are **Rated G** *(means ISFW)*.

###### **Contributions**
Come one, come all! If you think this script can be improved in any way shape or form, please submit a PR. GIF puns are highly recommended with PR titles and commits.
